Problem 1:
A. While addressing the missing values, I used the average of the values in the Assault column because that is where the missing value was located. I used the average because with numeric values it is smarter to take the average of the values and replace empty or null values. 
B. In my analysis of the data to address any outliers, I did not see any data that would be cosidered noisy or to be an outlier. All of the data presented did not contain negative or were drastically affecting the data range.
C. When looking at this graph of murder rates, I can see that the states with the highest murder rates are states in the South. While states with the lowest murder rates, are either in the Northeast or Midwest of the United States. 
D. When analyzing the histogram, a total of 24 states have an assault rate in the range of 100 to 200, while only 2 states have less than 50. 
E. When analyzing the chart, the states will lower assault ratest tend to have higher murder rates. 
F. While discretizing the data for US Arrests, I noticed that in states with EXTRA LARGE population sizes (80-100), the amount of assaults were high as well. In states with lower population sizes, the rate of assaults went down, but murder rates tended to be higher.

Problem 2:
A. In this dataset when I addressed the missing values, I used the same method that I used in the first problem. I used the average of the values in the column because the values were all numeric. 
B. While analyzing the data, I noticed some drops in mortality rates during 1995 and 2000. While there were increases in mortality rates in the early 2000s. The reason for this could be increased access to healthcare or increased access to birth control in the U.S. Also, when discretizing the data, I noticed that Under-5 mortality rates tend to be much higher than neonatal mortality rates. The reason for this could be an increase in birth defects in children or an increase in premature births that result in death. 

When discreitzing the data, I used the following ranges to determine which group to assign each value.
VERY LOW = 0-20
LOW = 20-40
MEDIUM = 40-60
HIGH = 60-80
VERY HIGH = 80-100
In the Excel sheet labeled, "Child Mortality Rates", I added a column beside each given mortality rate to assign a group to each year.

SQL:
C: 

2. Which years have the lowest and highest infant mortality years, respectively?
3. In what years the neonatal mortality rates were above average?
  - 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003
4. Display the sorted infant mortality rates in descending order.

6. Add a new column called Above-Five Mortality Rate and populate it with appropriate values. 
  - When I added the new column, I populated the the column with the average of the entire Under_5 mortality rate column. Since we do not have access to any information about the above 5 mortality rates, the best thing to do is to take the average of the column and populate the new coumn with this value.
