Project 1:

Problem 1:
- In this data set, the following minimums, maximums, and averages were found for each chicken seed that was presented:
	          min	    max	    mean
horsebean	  108	    227	    160.2
linseed	    	  141	    309	    218.75
soybean	    	  158	    329	    246.4285714
sunflower	  226	    423	    328.9166667
meatmeal	  153	    380	    276.9090909
casein	    	  216	    404	    323.5833333

- Based on this chicken feed data, the chicken food that appears the most beneficial for a thriving poultry business would be sunflower seed because it has the highest min, max, and mean weight among their chickens. With a higher weight means more meat on the chickens which allows more profit for the poultry business. 

Problem 2:
- In this data set, the following minimums, maximums, and averages were found for each insurance provider ratings:
	            min	  max	  mean
GEICO	       	    4.7	  8.3	  6.5
Progressive	    6.7	  8.9	  7.666666667
USAA	            3.8	  8.1	  6.066666667

- Based on this insurance data only, the company I would most likely choose would be Progressive because it has the highest ratings compared to GEICO and USAA. Companies with higher ratings tend to be better with their policies and treat their customers better than companies with lower ratings.
